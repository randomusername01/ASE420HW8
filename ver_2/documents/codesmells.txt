Complex Conditional Statements: Certain functions contained complex nested conditional statements that were hard to follow. We refactored these functions to simplify the logic.

Unclear Function Names: Functions in the commands.py file had confusing names for their function so they were renamed.

Duplicate Code in formatTime.py: Extracted duplicate code into classes

Use of flag variable: Replaced flag with a variable (time_format_24hr) that has a meaningful name

If-else block covering the entire main function: Refactored by applying the command design pattern and moving the logic into it.

Violation of SRP

Bloated Function
